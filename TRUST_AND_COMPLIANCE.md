# Project Gumpo: Parent Trust & Compliance Framing

## Overview
Parents are the most critical stakeholders in Gumpo. Their **trust** is the foundation of adoption. This document defines how Gumpo communicates **privacy, security, and compliance** through UI copy, notifications, access boundaries, and transparency. The goal is to make parents feel **secure, respected, and empowered** - not surveilled.

---

## Core Trust Principles

### 1. Data is About Their Child, Not Surveillance
**Message:** "We only collect what helps your child's learning."

❌ **Don't say:** "We track your child's every activity"
✅ **Do say:** "Teachers share daily updates about what your child learned and how they're growing"

### 2. Parents Always Have Control
**Message:** "You control what you see and who sees what about your family."

❌ **Don't say:** "The school has access to all your communications"
✅ **Do say:** "Your conversations with teachers are private - only you and the teacher can see them"

### 3. Security is Automatic, Not a Burden
**Message:** "We protect your data with the same security banks use."

❌ **Don't say:** "You need to set up 2FA for security"
✅ **Do say:** "Your account is automatically protected with encryption"

### 4. Compliance is Non-Negotiable
**Message:** "We follow strict laws to protect children and families."

❌ **Don't say:** "Compliant with POPIA regulations"
✅ **Do say:** "Your family's privacy is protected by South African law. Here's how."
