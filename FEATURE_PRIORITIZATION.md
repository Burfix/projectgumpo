## Risk & Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|
| Scope creep | Cut features ruthlessly; Phase 2 catches them |
| Performance issues | Load test by week 8 |
| Data privacy concerns | Implement RBAC + data isolation from day 1 |
| Poor UX adoption | Get pilot school feedback by week 6 |
| Email delivery failures | Use reliable service (SendGrid, AWS SES) |
| Teacher resistance | Emphasize time savings (attendance in 30 sec) |
