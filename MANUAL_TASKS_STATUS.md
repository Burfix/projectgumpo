## 1. 🔐 Key Rotation Status

### Supabase Service Role Key

**Status:** ⚠️ **UNKNOWN** (Functional but rotation cannot be confirmed)

**Test Results:**
- ✅ Key exists in `.env.local`
- ✅ Key is functional (database queries work)
- ❓ Cannot verify if key was actually rotated

**Why we can't verify:**
- The old key was removed from git history, so we can't compare
- A working key doesn't tell us if it's the NEW key or OLD key
- Only you can confirm by checking when it was generated in Supabase dashboard

**How to verify manually:**
```bash
1. Go to: https://app.supabase.com/project/YOUR_PROJECT/settings/api
2. Check "Service role key" section
3. Look at "Created" or "Last rotated" timestamp
4. If it's recent (today), key was rotated ✅
5. If it's old (before Feb 15, 2026), key needs rotation ❌
```

**To rotate the key:**
```bash
1. In Supabase Dashboard → Settings → API
2. Click "Regenerate" next to Service Role key
3. Copy the NEW key
4. Update .env.local:
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=paste_new_key_here
5. Update Vercel environment variables
6. Redeploy: git push origin master (triggers auto-deploy)
```

## 2. 🚀 Production Deployment Status

**Status:** ✅ **DEPLOYED** (Week 1 changes are live)

**Test Results:**
- ✅ Site is accessible: https://projectgumpo.space (HTTP 200)
- ✅ Serving content: "Project Goose - School Management"
- ✅ Vercel deployment active (cache working)
- ✅ Latest commits pushed to origin/master
- ✅ Auto-deployment from git working

**Latest Deployed Commit:**
```
d43c271 - chore: Add automated security verification script
```

**Deployment Details:**
- Server: Vercel
- Cache Status: HIT (performing well)
- Region: cpt1 (Cape Town)
- Last Deploy: February 15, 2026

**Note:** Production is automatically deploying from master branch. Your Week 1 security changes are LIVE.

## 3. 📊 Sentry Setup Status

**Status:** ❌ **NOT CONFIGURED**

**Test Results:**
- ❌ No `SENTRY_DSN` in `.env.local`
- ❌ Environment variable not set
- ⚠️  Sentry config files exist but won't activate without DSN
- ⚠️  Errors are NOT being tracked

**What's Ready:**
- ✅ Sentry config files: `sentry.client.config.js`, `sentry.server.config.js`
- ✅ Error handling system with `logError()` function
- ✅ Code is instrumented and ready to send errors

**What's Missing:**
- ❌ SENTRY_DSN environment variable

**To configure Sentry:**

### Option A: Skip for Now (Development Only)
```bash
# Errors will only log to console
# Fine for development, but production should have monitoring
```

### Option B: Set up Sentry (Recommended for Production)
```bash
1. Create Sentry account: https://sentry.io
2. Create new project → Select "Next.js"
3. Copy your DSN (looks like: https://abc123@sentry.io/456789)
4. Add to .env.local:
   SENTRY_DSN=your_dsn_here
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN=your_dsn_here
5. Add to Vercel environment variables
6. Redeploy
7. Trigger test error to verify
```

## 🎯 Recommended Next Steps

### If Key Rotation is Uncertain:
1. Check Supabase dashboard for key creation date
2. If uncertain, rotate now (takes 2 minutes)
3. Update .env.local and Vercel
4. Git push to redeploy

### For Sentry Setup:
- **For pilot/production:** Set up Sentry now (P1 priority)
- **For development only:** Can skip for now (P2 priority)

### Ready for Week 2:
If you've rotated keys (or verified they're new), you can proceed to Week 2 implementation:
- Input validation (Zod schemas)
- Rate limiting middleware
- Database indexes
- Security headers
